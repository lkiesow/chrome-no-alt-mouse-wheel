No-Alt-Mouse-Wheel Chrome Extension
===================================

Prevent mouse wheel scrolling if alt is pressed.

This comes in handy if system events are already bound to scrolling with
modifier keys like for example the window managers desktop zoom accessibility
feature which would otherwise cause page-scrolling in Chrome every time it is
being used.
